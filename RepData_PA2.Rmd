# Title (briefly describe analysis)

## Synopsis (description of analysis in 10 complete sentences)

## Data processing 

### Loading the data and reading in data

Data was downloaded from `https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2` and unzipped.

```{r download and unzip}
if(!file.exists("stormdata.bz2")){
    download.file(
        url = "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2", 
        destfile = "stormdata.bz2", 
        method = "curl")}

if(!file.exists("UCI HAR Dataset")){
    unzip("stormdata.bz2")
}

```

(describes (in words and code) how the data were loaded into R and processed for analysis. In particular, your analysis must start from the raw CSV file containing the data. You cannot do any preprocessing outside the document. If preprocessing is time-consuming you may consider using the cache = TRUE option for certain code chunks.)

## Conclusion

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
